# URLs to allow list for App Center
If you're behind a firewall and want to connect to App Center, here are the URLs to allow list for App Center:

- api.appcenter.ms
- api.mobile.azure.com
- *.appcenter.ms

## Service-specific considerations
Some App Center services might need additional items on your allow list:

- [Build allow list info](~/build/connect.md#connecting-to-a-source-repository)
- [Test allow list info](~/test-cloud/troubleshooting/server-connection.md)
