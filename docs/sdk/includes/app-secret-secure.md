The `app_secret` is an identifier of your app, it's required to know which app the traffic applies to and it can not be used to retrieve or edit existing data. If your `app_secret` is exposed, the biggest risk is sending bad data to your app, but it won't have an effect on the security of the data. If you find any suspicious traffic in your analytics data you can create a new `app_secret` and update it in your app.

To retrieve any sensitive data, you'd need to provide an app/user [token](../../api-docs/index.md), which is generated on the clientâ€™s side. There's no way to make data on the client's side completely secure. 

You can improve your app's security by using an environment variable (on CI/CD for example) to inject the app secret into your code. That way, the secret isn't visible in your code.
