### 3.3 Integration via Swift Package Manager

> [!NOTE]
> Only the **Analytics** and **Crashes** modules support the use of Swift Package Manager at the moment.

1. From the Xcode menu click **File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency**.
1. In the dialog that appears, enter the repository URL: https://github.com/microsoft/appcenter-sdk-apple.git.
1. In **Version**, select **Up to Next Major** and take the default option.
1. Choose **AppCenterAnalytics** and/or **AppCenterCrashes** in the **Package Product** column.

Now that you've integrated the frameworks in your application, it's time to start the SDK and make use of the App Center services.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're integrating App Center via SwiftPM and want to use it in your app's extension target as well, make sure that you provide `DISABLE_DIAMOND_PROBLEM_DIAGNOSTIC=YES` in your configuration. This is necessary to avoid SwiftPM limitations in linking a module to multiple targets.
