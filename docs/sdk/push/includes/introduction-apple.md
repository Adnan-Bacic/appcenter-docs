## Add App Center Push to your app

### 1. Add the App Center Push module

The App Center SDK is designed with a modular approach – you only need to integrate the services that you're interested in.

#### Integration via Cocoapods

If you're integrating App Center into your app via Cocoapods, add the following dependency to your podfile and run `pod install`.

```ruby
pod 'AppCenter/Push'
```

#### Integration via Carthage

1. Add the following dependency to your `Cartfile` to include App Center.

    ```ruby
    # Use the following line to get the latest version of App Center
    github "microsoft/appcenter-sdk-apple"
    ```

    ```ruby
    # Use the following line to get the specific version of App Center
    github "microsoft/appcenter-sdk-apple" ~> X.X.X
    ```

1. Run `carthage update`.
1. Open your application target's **General** settings tab. Drag and drop the **AppCenterPush.framework** file from the **Carthage/Build/iOS** folder to the **Linked Frameworks and Libraries** section in XCode.
1. A dialog will appear, make sure your app target is checked. Then click **Finish**.

#### Integration by copying the binaries into your project

If you don't want to use Cocoapods, you can integrate the modules by copying the binaries into your project. Follow the steps below:

1. Download the [App Center SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/AppCenter-SDK-Apple/releases) frameworks provided as a zip file.

2. Unzip the file and you'll see a folder called **AppCenter-SDK-Apple** that contains different frameworks for each App Center service on each platform folder. The framework called `AppCenter` is required in the project as it contains code that's shared between the different modules.

3. [Optional] Create a subdirectory for 3rd-party-libraries.
   * As a best practice, 3rd-party libraries usually reside inside a subdirectory (it is often called **Vendor**), so if you don't have your project organized with a subdirectory for libraries, create a **Vendor** subdirectory now.
   * Create a group called **Vendor** inside your Xcode project to mimic your file structure on disk.

4. Open the unziped **AppCenter-SDK-Apple** folder in Finder and copy the folder into your project's folder at the location where you want it to reside. The folder contains frameworks in subfolders for other platforms that App Center SDK supports, so you might need to delete subfolders that you don't need.

5. Add the SDK framework to the project in Xcode:
   * Make sure the Project Navigator is visible (⌘+1).
   * Now drag and drop **AppCenter.framework** and **AppCenterPush.framework** from the Finder (the ones inside the **Vendor** folder) into Xcode's Project Navigator. Note that **AppCenter.framework** is required to start the SDK, make sure it is added to your project, otherwise the other module won't work and your project won't compile successfully.
   * A dialog will appear, make sure your app target is checked. Then click **Finish**.

### 2. Start App Center Push

In order to use App Center, you must opt in to the module(s) that you want to use. By default no modules are started and you'll have to explicitly call each of them when starting the SDK.

#### 2.1 Add the import for App Center Push

Open the project's **AppDelegate.m** file  in Objective-C or **AppDelegate.swift** file in Swift and add the following import statements:

```objc
@import AppCenter;
@import AppCenterPush;
```
```swift
import AppCenter
import AppCenterPush
```
