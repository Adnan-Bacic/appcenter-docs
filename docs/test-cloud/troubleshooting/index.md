# Test Troubleshooting
The documents in this section provide general troubleshooting tips for App Center Test. 

## General Tips
If you're unsure how to diagonse your issue, here are some general tips:

- Confirm your tests work locally. Ideally compare similar device model(s) and OS versions to minimize variables.
- **iOS simulator app packages can't be uploaded to Test**. Test requires a iOS device build (IPA) that our system can re-sign using our Development Provisining files. 
- Your test suite might need [extra time](time-outs.md) or a [server connection](server-connection.md) to reliably pass tests in App Center.
- Test can't automate multiple apps, or system apps (browser, camera, etc.). This limitation is true even for testing frameworks that allow full system control locally. 

## Common Documented Issues
- [(Android) missing or corrupted screenshots](android-screenshots.md)
- [(iOS) Privacy Alerts](ios-privacy-alerts.md)
- [(iOS) Incorrect coordinates](incorrect-ios-coordinates.md)
- [CLI exit codes](cli-exit-codes.md)
- [Database changes during tests](database-changes.md)
- [Device idling](sleep.md)
- [Device log analysis](device-logs.md)
- [Stalled devices](stalls.md)
- [Time limits](time-outs.md)
- [Web & server connection issues](server-connection.md)
