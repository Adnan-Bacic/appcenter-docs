# Build Troubleshoooting
The guides in this section provide general troubleshooting tips for App Center Build.

## General Tips
If you're unsure how to diagnose your issue, here are some general tips:
- [Isolate differences between working & passing builds](~/build/troubleshooting/build-failed.md).
- [Download Build data for local backup & comparison](~/build/troubleshooting/backup-data.md).
- If your build uses [custom build scripts](~/build/custom/scripts/index.md), it's a good idea to test them locally. Don't forget to manually save your Build configuration when adding, deleting, moving or renaming scripts in your repo.
